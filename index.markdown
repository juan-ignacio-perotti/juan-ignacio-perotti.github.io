I graduated as a Licenciado en Física (roughly a MS in Physics) and completed my Doctoral [Thesis][] (in Spanish) at FaMAF under the supervision of [Dr. Sergio A. Cannas][Cannas].
 
I made a three postdocs: the first [FaMAF][FaMAF]-[UNC][UNC], the second at (former) BECS, [Aalto University][Aalto], Espoo, Finland and the third at [IMT][IMT], Lucca, Italy.
 
Currently, I am an adjunct researcher of [CONICET][CONICET], researching Complex Systems and Complex Networks at [IFEG-CONICET][IFEG-CONICET] as a member of the [GTMC][GTMC] and teaching as an Assistant Profesor at [FaMAF][FaMAF]-[UNC][UNC], [Córdoba,Argentina][Cordoba-Argentina].
